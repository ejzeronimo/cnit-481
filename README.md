# CNIT 481fed
This repo is for all of my personal answers and configs pertaining to the CNIT 481 front end design class. 
## Archived
This repo is part of my college coursework and will be archived as I have completed college and no changes will be made to them.
## Usage
Please do not use these labs or projects as your own, I answered all of these questions myself and to use this directly in your own lab would be considered plagiarism.

**That being said** please feel free to reference any questions, diagrams, or reports that are in this repo. I made this project open source so that any prospective students can look at (hopefully correct) answers.

*I will try to go back and update questions that were incorrect.*
### Labs
The lab folder should be structred as follows:
- Lab #
  - *.js
  - *.html
  - *.css
  - *.pdf

All files are my solution to any requirement for a certain lab.
## Prerequisites
The wireframes assume the use of the tool **Balsamiq Wireframes**, which was the course standard. The download can be found [here](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).
## Issues
For any issues please create an issue in this repo and I will try to respond promptly.
